# Spain-Route-Finder-Dijkstra-s-Algorithm-in-Java
This project implements a custom graph-based pathfinding system in Java to calculate the shortest routes between cities in Spain using Dijkstra’s algorithm. It includes custom data structures (MyHashMap, MyHashSet, DLList, etc.) and a simple visualization interface that maps city connections with images.
